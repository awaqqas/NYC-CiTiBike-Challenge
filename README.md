# NYC-CiTiBike-Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal; a bike trip analysis was conducted. Since the data was not in the correct format, python was utilized to convert dates into date-time 64 format. Once, dates were converted, Tableau was utilized to create this analysis in a form of storyboard. The analysis comprises of checkout times, trips by weekday, trips by user, trips by gender, a breakdown of which gender utilizes the most bikes with a final breakdown of which type of customer utilizes bikes the most. 

## Results

According to the checkout time usage graph it turns out approximately 3,000 users checkout bikes for at least 4-6 hours. Approximately 600-700 users checkout bikes for 1 hour or 21 plus hours. This is feasible, as no user would be actually using the bike for 20 plus hours straight and as such it is ideal that not many users checkout bikes for 20 plus hours.

To further understand which particular user is checking out the bikes the most for 5 hours or more, a gender breakdown was conducted. It turns out males are the most popular users of the bike. In fact, it can be noted that 3x more males checkout bikes than females.

Additionally, majority of the trips are conducted between the morning hours of 8AM-9AM and the evening hours of 5-6PM from Monday through Friday. Ofcourse, this makes sense, since these times also correlate with normal workhours.

To analyze, if the checkout time usage correlates with trips by weekday on an hourly basis, a gender breakdown analysis was conducted. As expected, majority of the trips carried out on weekdays by hour are males. In addition, males tend to do these trips during work hours from Monday through Friday.

So far, it has been established that males constitute of majority of the bike usage along with trips. As such, it would be advisable to figure out if these male users fall under customers or subscribers. It turns out, majority of the trips are carried out by male subscribers from Monday through Friday.

To sum up the analysis, final numbers were calculated to determine how many males use the bikes in comparison to females. As expected, the pie chart depicts more male users than both females and unknowns combined.

Similarly, numbers for customers and subscribers were also calculated. As expected from earlier analysis, subscrbers utilize bikes more than customers. 

## Summary
Overall, this analysis pushes the investors to also figure out strategies to increase bike usage amongst females and customers. Perhaps, these bikes are more readily-available for male subscribers versus other users? Locations of these bikes would be a good useful visualization tool to determine if locations are a factor in these numbers. Additionally, it would also be beneficial to view the inventory of bikes by hour. Perhaps, inventory becomes an issue during peak times?
